1. [Load Balancing](building-blocks/load-balancing.md) - Helps spread traffic across a cluster of servers. if server is unavailable, LB will route to different server
2. [Caching](building-blocks/caching.md) - Load balancing helps you scale horizontally across servers but caching helps you make better use of resources you already have as well as making otherwise unatainable product requriements feasible.
3. [Data Partitioning](building-blocks/data-partitioning.md)
