# ⚖️ SysDE Trade‑Offs Cheat Sheet (with Embedded Analogies)

| **Trade‑Off**                           | **Definition**                                                                       | **Cloud Example**                                 | **Embedded Analogy**                                                                              | **Interview Soundbite**                                                                         |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Strong vs Eventual Consistency**      | Strong = all nodes agree instantly; Eventual = nodes converge over time.             | Banking ledger vs social media likes.             | Satellite telemetry uplink (strong) vs ground station logs syncing later (eventual).              | “Strong consistency protects correctness; eventual consistency scales better under partitions.” |
| **Latency vs Throughput**               | Latency = response time; Throughput = volume processed per unit time.                | Fast checkout vs bulk order processing.           | Real‑time command response vs batch telemetry dumps.                                              | “Optimizing latency helps user experience; throughput optimizes system efficiency.”             |
| **ACID vs BASE**                        | ACID = strict consistency; BASE = flexible, eventually consistent.                   | Bank transfers vs product catalog.                | Flight software command sequencing (ACID) vs housekeeping telemetry collection (BASE).            | “ACID ensures correctness; BASE trades consistency for availability and scale.”                 |
| **Read‑Through vs Write‑Through Cache** | Read‑through = cache loads on miss; Write‑through = cache updated on every write.    | Redis read‑through vs DynamoDB DAX write‑through. | Telemetry buffer refresh on demand (read‑through) vs updating buffer every write (write‑through). | “Read‑through optimizes reads; write‑through ensures consistency but adds write latency.”       |
| **Batch vs Stream Processing**          | Batch = scheduled, large chunks; Stream = continuous, real‑time.                     | Payroll vs fraud detection.                       | Daily ground data dumps vs continuous spacecraft health monitoring.                               | “Batch is efficient for bulk jobs; stream is essential for real‑time responsiveness.”           |
| **Load Balancer vs API Gateway**        | LB = distributes traffic; Gateway = adds routing, auth, monitoring.                  | ELB vs API Gateway.                               | RF switch distributing signals (LB) vs command sequencer enforcing rules (Gateway).               | “Load balancer spreads load; API gateway enforces policies and orchestrates requests.”          |
| **Proxy vs Reverse Proxy**              | Proxy = client‑side mediator; Reverse proxy = server‑side mediator.                  | VPN client vs Nginx front‑end.                    | Ground station uplink proxy vs spacecraft command router.                                         | “Proxy hides clients; reverse proxy protects servers and adds caching.”                         |
| **Serverless vs Traditional Servers**   | Serverless = auto‑scaling, pay‑per‑use; Traditional = fixed servers, full control.   | Lambda vs EC2.                                    | Renting ground station time (serverless) vs owning dedicated antenna hardware (traditional).      | “Serverless reduces ops overhead; traditional servers give control but add cost.”               |
| **Stateful vs Stateless Architecture**  | Stateful = server tracks session; Stateless = each request independent.              | Stateful chat vs stateless REST API.              | Persistent spacecraft mode tracking (stateful) vs one‑off telemetry queries (stateless).          | “Stateless scales horizontally; stateful simplifies session logic but complicates scaling.”     |
| **Token Bucket vs Leaky Bucket**        | Rate limiting algorithms. Token bucket = bursty allowed; Leaky bucket = steady flow. | API rate limiting.                                | Command queue allowing bursts (token) vs fixed‑rate telemetry downlink (leaky).                   | “Token bucket allows bursts; leaky bucket enforces smooth, predictable traffic.”                |

## 🧠 How to Drill

- **Daily:** Pick 2 trade‑offs, rehearse aloud in 30 seconds each.
- **Structure:** Definition → Cloud example → Embedded analogy → Soundbite.
- **Goal:** Show you can _translate embedded rigor into cloud vocabulary_ — that’s your differentiator.
